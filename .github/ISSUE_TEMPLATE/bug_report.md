**Describe the bug**

<!-- The harness seems to be loose to the panda (is that what you call it?)  I have to hold the pins tight on the harness to the panda and it will work for a while but eventually do the same thing.

**How to reproduce or log data**

<!-- It does the same almost everyday for the last two weeks.  If I don't hold the harness tight to the panda, it will eventually do the same thing. -->

**Expected behavior**

<!-- The same thing happens daily.  The connection is loose it tells me there is a communication error and restart the car(flashing red). -->
